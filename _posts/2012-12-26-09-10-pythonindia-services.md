Python India offers space for hosting website, blog etc. and email redirection for Python usergroups in India.

[Bangalore][] and [Pune][] usergroups have already started used this service.  Currently, only static websites generated using [Mynt][], [Pelican][], [Jekyll][] etc. are supported.

If you would like to setup a website for Python usergroup in your city, please drop an email to _webmaster-at-python.org.in_.

Apart from the usergroup websites, Python India maintains a [wiki][] and a [planet][] for aggregating blogs of Python developers in India.

Python India thanks [E2E Networks][e2e] for sponsoring a VPS server.
